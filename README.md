# Getting Started with Weather App

This project was created using React and Node JS for front-end. For back-end REST API calls are made to display weather information 

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

## Once you are done with the above mentioned step you'll be able to see a UI Page

In the UI Page enter city and you will be able to see weather information of the city including temperature, humidity, and pressure.

## Weather data is displayed using rest api hosted on https://openweathermap.org/ 

This app is able to fetch weather information from Openweathermap endpoint. On submit of the form a rest api call is sent and fetched data is displayed to the user.

## Future enhancements 

This app can be further improvised by adding more pictorial representations and other more details could be fetched from the API.
